Welcome to JetsubEX!

JetsubEX is a pack of ROOT macros to calculate Qjet variables and Nsubjettiness with Delphes file input.
Before we start, you need to do servral things to make this run correctly.


1. Make sure FastJet plugin is installed on the system.
   The lastest Fastjet plugin can be found here: http://fastjet.fr/

2. The DELPHESPATH variable in makefile should be redefined to the correct path of Delphes.
   Go to the makefile and change it.

3. Every thing is ready.
   Open the Terminal, source ROOT, cd this Folder and type $make.
   If you're lucky enough, shared library JetSub.so should be compiled now.
   
4. Runtime commands are stored in Exc.C, you need to provide the name of Delphes ROOT file being analyzed.
   Open ROOT and type .x Exc.C , get yourself a cup of tea and see the analysis result.
   You can also change the Exc.C macro to alter the analyzing contents.

   
If you have any problem building or running the macro, feel free to contact me.
